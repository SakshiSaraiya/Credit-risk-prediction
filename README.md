# Credit-risk-prediction
Credit Risk Prediction is a machine learning-based web application designed to help financial institutions evaluate whether a loan applicant is likely to be a credit risk. The project involves preprocessing and analyzing credit data, training models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression, and deploying the best-performing model through a user-friendly interface built using Streamlit. The application takes user inputs such as gender, marital status, education, income, loan amount, and credit history to predict loan approval likelihood. It leverages Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data processing and model development. The repository includes a Jupyter notebook (Credit Risk prediction.py) containing data analysis and model training, and a deployment script (app.py) for running the web interface. Users can easily run the project locally using Streamlit, and the output provides a clear prediction indicating whether the applicant is likely to be approved or rejected. Future enhancements could include integrating more features like credit scores, adding model interpretability tools like SHAP, and connecting the app to a real-time database.
